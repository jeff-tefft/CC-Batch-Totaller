# CC-Batch-Totaller
This script pulls all the CC transaction data and breaks out takings from refunds, totaled by batch number.

The VBA script runs inside an excel worksheet, attached to a button. It pulls data from all the .xls files in a folder titled CC Batches and puts it into the excel worksheet so the data can be reconciled against the reports from the e-commerce platform and the accounting software.

A sample spreadsheet and folder with .xls files in the appropriate format with fake data have been provided to show how it works in practice.
